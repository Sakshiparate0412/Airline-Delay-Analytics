# Airline-Delay-Analytics
Airline Delay Analytics is a data analysis and machine learning project focused on understanding and predicting flight delays using historical airline data. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building predictive models to identify key factors influencing delays, such as airline carriers, airports, time of travel, and operational conditions. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, the project analyzes delay patterns and develops classification models to improve prediction accuracy. The insights derived from this analysis can help airlines optimize operations, reduce delays, and enhance overall passenger experience.
